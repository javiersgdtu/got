This project includes the JS code (D3.js) to plot a Game of Thrones Scatter Graph with the time in screen of all characters in each episode. Also a spoiler checkbox reveals all deaths in the show.
Created for my webinar of D3.js visualization : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNomm3JU9Ig (in Spanish). I used the datasets created by Jeffrey Lancaster (https://github.com/jeffreylancaster).

In the /data folder you can find a Jupyter notebook with the code used to preprocess the data to
the formatted json used in the graph.

In the /data/data_out folder you can find the formatted json file used in the visualization (got.json)
